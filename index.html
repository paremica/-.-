                <p><strong>Advisor:</strong> Pavel Vorobiev</p>
                <p>
                    • Detected the percolation threshold using image classification algorithms by simulating circular particles in a 2D space and classifying images into "percolates" and "does not percolate" categories to generate a database.<br>
                    • Trained an image detection algorithm using the Prophet library and tested its effectiveness with images obtained from scanning electron microscopy.

                <h3>Dynamic Load Transfer Systems for Uninterrupted Power Supply</h3>
                <p>
                    Dynamic load transfer systems use advanced algorithms, real-time monitoring, and artificial intelligence (AI) to manage and transfer loads between multiple power sources and breakers seamlessly. These systems ensure uninterrupted power during maintenance activities by dynamically balancing and transferring loads based on real-time data and predictive analytics.

                <h3>iSolenum | Solar Stove Project</h3>
                <p>
                    The intent of this study is to conduct a thorough evaluation and propose an optimized redesign of the iSolenum solar stove, enhancing its utility and efficacy for impoverished communities in Chiapas, Mexico. The primary aim of this research is to devise a viable and cost-effective solution to the grave health and environmental challenges posed by the reliance on conventional fuels. The proposed innovation encompasses the development of an advanced solar stove, which leverages a heliodome to concentrate solar radiation, thereby generating adequate thermal energy for cooking purposes. This methodology is firmly rooted in the principles of thermodynamics and solar energy harnessing, aspiring to present a sustainable and health-conscious alternative to the prevalent use of traditional wood-burning stoves.

                <p>
                    Here are the projects with the greatest impact in this course. First, there is a scientific article that uses a mathematical model similar to that used to study COVID-19, specifically the predator-prey model with the Lotka-Volterra model, and an analysis of its application to animals is conducted. Additionally, the final project of the course is presented, which consists of an analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic based on data provided by the Ministry of Health of the Government of Mexico.

                    This evidence presents a solved problem. As is well known, Mexico has been one of the countries with the highest obesity rates. Therefore, as a solution, an analysis of the reduction in body fat over a period of 3 months was conducted. Additionally, a Python code was developed to verify the obtained results.

                <p>
                    Currently, applications for identifying songs, such as Shazam, are very popular. These applications use the fast Fourier transform to identify songs. In our case, to create a similar algorithm, we downloaded some songs and added them to our database to have "base" songs that the algorithm could identify. We created two .mlx files for song recognition: one for the audio and another for the database, to which we added all the downloaded songs.

                    The training partner has raised the need to integrate waveguides coupled to the chip (in the substrate), responsible for directing and focusing light in a specific region (at 70 um) on the surface of the ion trap. This document presents the solution to the problem, as well as a simulation in COMSOL Multiphysics.

                <p>
                    The objective of the challenge is for the student to handle the fringe projection technique at an introductory level for obtaining 3D information. The challenge consists of designing and constructing an optical system that allows obtaining a three-dimensional image, at the surface level, of an object. The choice of the object to be reconstructed can be arbitrary, but some objects are suggested at the end of this description for better results.
